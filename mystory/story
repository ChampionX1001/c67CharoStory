There was once a boy name Charo. 
Charo loved chocolate. 
Sadly, he developed an allergy to chocolate.
It has been 15 years since Charo has eaten chocolate.
Luckily for Charo, a company made a device that can cure allergy.
The only tradeoff was that it was incredibly painful and took away 50 years from lifespan.
